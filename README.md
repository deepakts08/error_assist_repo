error_assist_repo
=================

This is a project to build error assist Editor. I have an idea to build an code editor Say, for C programming.

Here I explain how it works 

1. When a C program executes it produces either error or exceutes successfully.

2. If it produces error , the error must be carried to a remote server.

3. This server has tons of analized solutions which it collected from forums 

4. the server returns back possible solution to the  code editor

5. hence reducing the development time
